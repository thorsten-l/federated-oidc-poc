OIDF Marks granted to Licensees are subject to the following rules and
requirements, which are incorporated in the applicable Trademark Licenses by

Marks shall inure to the sole benefit of, and be owned exclusively by,
OIDF.

2.2. Identification of Owner. All uses of any OIDF Mark must clearly identify the

or to any of the OIDF Marks, other than the license to use the OIDF

and only for so long as such agreement and Trademark License
remains in place. Use of the OIDF Marks shall create no rights for
Licensee in or to any of the OIDF Marks beyond the terms and
conditions of such limited Trademark License and this Trademark
Usage Policy.

2.5. No Alterations. No right to create modifications or derivatives of OIDF Marks is
granted to any Licensee. The OIDF Marks may not be revised or altered in any

KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.

2.14.Questions. Questions about this license should be sent to help@oidf.org.

3. Use of “OpenID Certified” Certification Mark.
In addition to the foregoing general requirements, the Trademark License to use the
“OpenID Certified” certification mark granted to Implementers in the Terms and
Conditions for Certification of Conformance to an OpenID Connect Conformance
Profile (“Certification Terms”) is also subject to the following rules and
requirements, which are incorporated in such Certification Terms by reference:

3.1. The “OpenID Certified” certification mark is a visual manifestation of the status
of the Implementer’s Deployment as having been self-certified as conforming to
the OpenID Connect Conformance Profile.

3.2. An Implementer may announce self-certification of its Deployment in a press
release, and include the “OpenID Certified” certification mark as evidence that
its Deployment has met the requirements for self-certification established by
OIDF.

3.3. An Implementer may use the “OpenID Certified” certification mark only in
connection with the Deployment that is the subject of such self-certification and
only so long as such self-certification remains posted and publicly available
from OIDF or a registry selected by OIDF.

3.4. The “OpenID Certified” certification mark may not be used in a manner that
implies any endorsement of the Implementer or such Deployment by OIDF, or
the existence of any certification, authorization, or affiliation that does not exist
with respect to OIDF.

3.5. The “OpenID Certified” certification mark may be placed on the Implementer’s
website, but only in a manner that clearly identifies the Deployment to which it
relates, and only in a form that constitutes a link
to: http://openid.net/certification/.

3.6. The “OpenID Certified” certification mark must be removed from the
Implementer’s website under certain circumstances including, but not limited
to: (1) the Deployment self-certification ceases to be active or accurate; (2) the
Implementer fails to comply with the Certification Terms or these Trademark
Usage Guidelines; or (3) the Implementer ceases operations with respect to the
Deployment

3.7. Failure to comply with these Trademark Usage Guidelines may result in
enforcement of the “OpenID Certified” certification mark, including but not
limited to, through an action for infringement of the mark, an action for breach
of contract, and/or a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for investigation
of an unfair or deceptive trade practice under section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act.

3.8. USE OF THE “OpenID Certified” CERTIFICATION MARK BY ANY PERSON
OR ORGANIZATION NOT AUTHORIZED BY OIDF IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE FOREGOING, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DEPLOYMENTTHAT IS
NOT THE SUBJECT OF A CURRENT AND VALID CERTIFICATION
ACCEPTED AND PUBLISHED BY OIDF, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

4. Guidelines for Non-Licensed Use of the OIDF Marks
These guidelines are for third parties who do not hold a license to use OIDF Marks
(“Non-Licensed Users”), but wish to use OIDF Marks (other than the OpenID Logo
and the OpenID Certified Logo) for referential or other fair use purposes in
promotional, advertising, instructional, or reference materials, or on their web sites,
products, labels, or packaging. Except for the limited right to use as expressly
permitted under these Guidelines, no other rights of any kind are granted
hereunder, by implication or otherwise.
The following guidelines apply:

4.1. The OIDF Marks must be used only to:
* describe or reference OIDF specifications, documents, software, or other
products listed at the OIDF web sites (collectively, “OIDF Products”), or
* describe non-OIDF products that implement the required features and
operations of OIDF Products. Required features and operations are defined
within OIDF specifications, often in accordance with [RFC2119].
Representations that products or services comply with any OIDF
specification must clearly indicate that the representations are made by the
Non-Licensed User, and not by the OIDF.

4.2. The OIDF Marks must only be used in a way that accurately reflects the
STATUS associated with the OIDF Products. The STATUS of an OIDF Product
describes the context in which the product was developed including the
publication date, intellectual property disclosures (e.g., copyright or patent
terms), location (URI), its publication level (Draft, Implementer’s Draft, Final
Specification, Note, Whitepaper), and future expectations regarding the OIDF
Product.

4.3. All such uses of the OIDF Marks are subject to and must comply with the
requirements of Section 2 above (“Use of OIDF Marks Generally”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Licensed User may not use the OpenID
Logo or the OpenID CERTIFIED Logo in any manner, in whole or in part.
